# ERP-Android-App-Java
This project was developed as part of my final thesis for the MSc in Control and Computing at the University of Athens. It is a complete ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) Android application designed to manage the key operations of a small business — including inventory, sales, and expenses — through a simple and responsive mobile interface.
The app is built entirely in Java using Android Studio, following the MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel) architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and clean code structure. It integrates Room Database for local data storage, with LiveData and ViewModel components to handle reactive updates and lifecycle-aware data management. The Repository Pattern is used to abstract database access and promote separation of concerns between the UI and the data layers.
Users can add, edit, and delete items in the warehouse, record sales transactions, and monitor expenses and profit summaries. All data is stored locally and can be easily extended for cloud synchronization or multi-user support in future iterations.
